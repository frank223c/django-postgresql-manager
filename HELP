How to read this document
-------------------------
This document is written in ``reStructuredText`` (*rst*). Although reStructuredText
is an easy-to-read plain text markup format, it is recommended to convert it
to *HTML* for a better reading experience.

In order to convert this document to *HTML* you need ``docutils``, which you can
install in your system using ``pip``::

    pip install docutils

Or ``easy_install``::

    easy_install docutils

Once ``docutils`` is installed, you can use the ``rst2html.py`` utility to
do the conversion::

    rst2html.py HELP help.html

Then use any web browser to view the exported ``help.html`` file.
